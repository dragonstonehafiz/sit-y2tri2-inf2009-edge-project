60 runs
avg inference time: 0.13s
phone image detection: not great
printed photo detection: better than with phone, but further the object is the less effective

avg inference time: 0.18s
phone image detection: not consistent enough
printed photo detection: can go a little further than 160, but real shotty at bad angles
